Exposure-based Perceptual Learning (EPL) has been catching my attention for some time now. I first got introduced to the term by [Sunil Pai's tweet](https://twitter.com/threepointone/status/1593927529265504257) reviewing the book _Badass: Making Users Awesome_ (I have to say, I haven't read the book yet, but I'm _dying_ to).

The best way for me to explain EPL is by saying that it's the ingredient that makes you become an "expert" (whatever that means), and you do that by consuming the content of other experts. For example, following on social media the experts in your field is a way of becoming better at your job.

Now my last example goes with a caveat: it's is **extremely difficult** to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to filtering who's an expert. People want to seem experts and people want to follow experts, so when it comes to Twitter or LinkedIn, the number of followers becomes an (highly) arguable metric to use.

Having said that, in some fields it is much easier to objectively know who is an expert. For example, in chess, a player's knowledge is benchmarked using a ranking. It's obvious that if you're in the Top 10 in the world, you're probably an expert.

But we were talking about Perceptual Learning.

One of the debates that are going on is should EPL be the main way of learning as opposed to deliberate study of a subject. I think that argument is a false dichotomy. The important question is, how to determine the balance of EPL vs deliberate study that should be applied depending on the specific topic.

So how have I applied EPL? I have 3 main fields where I consider EPL plays for me a huge role: jazz, chess and software engineering. The last two are very simple: the more you watch experts playing chess and the more code you read of other good programmers, the better you will become, but with both I have applied deliberate study for a long while, and have thus I found my balance.

But jazz for me has been an exception, as I think I've only applied EPL to learning, understanding and appreciating this genre.

My technique with jazz has been very simple and it composes of two parts: listen to a lot of it - that's the most obvious one. An the less obvious... and you'll be surprised this actually exists... is reaction videos! If you don't know what these are (lucky you), here's an example of a (more theoretical) reaction video https://youtu.be/iCtffPv9yKY?t=231 and a more fun example https://youtu.be/u7tR38ff7Hw?t=203.

The authors of these reaction videos have been the "experts" whose content I consume. Another way that I used is that when I'm watching a concert and a musician starts to improvise solo, I then start watching his or her bandmates' (experts) reaction and try to figure out what was it that made them react in a specific way.

After 3 years of doing it, many of my musician friends usually tell me that my reactions and understanding of what's going on in a jazz song seems more genuine and profound than a lot of their other musician colleagues. Which probably isn't, but you get my point.

Eventually I enjoyed jazz much more than I did when I started listening and the most important part, and even if I don't understand most of what's going on, I started to _feel_ it.
