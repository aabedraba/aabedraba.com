Christian Lete, my dear friend, has introduced me to the concept of The Pursuit lately. I've always been familiar with the saying that "the journey is better than the destination", but I never such a clear and visceral understanding of this concept until I was introduced to this word. 

It's interesting how sometimes we know of an idea, a notion or an abstraction, but without the right analogy, the concept doesn't really stick. I guess not every analogy works - a good analogy is something that calls for a deep emotion to be surfaced. 

For me The Pursuit has been experienced in different ways - my longing to join a company I really wanted to, my desire for a rebellion of mine to be proven, my waiting for the message of a girl I liked, the dream of forgetting...

I never enjoyed those moments. But these events always signified a powerful set of feelings of various shapes and colors, but they consistently made me feel alive. And I thought I was crazy for feeling that way.

The Pursuit starts very early on, with a smile, a complicit moment, a hug, a moment of silence, a gaze, a silent word. Regardless what it is that you want to achieve.

I look forward to a life that welcomes The Pursuit, that looks for it and embraces it. That enjoys every part of it. And to repeat it all over again. Always.
