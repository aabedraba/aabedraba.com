Christian Lete, my dear friend, has introduced me to the concept of The Pursuit. I've always been familiar with the saying that "the journey is better than the destination", but I never had such a clear and visceral understanding of this concept until I was introduced to this word.

It's interesting how sometimes we know of an idea, a notion or an abstraction, but without the right analogy the concept doesn't really stick. And I guess not every analogy works - a good analogy is something that calls for a deep emotion to be surfaced. 

When I heard about The Pursuit for the first time, I thought of intense feelings I had like my longing to join a company I really wanted to, my desire for a rebellion of mine to be proven right, my waiting for the message of a girl I liked, the dream of forgetting...

I never enjoyed those moments. But they consistently made me feel alive.

The Pursuit starts very early on, with a smile, a complicit moment, a hug, a moment of silence, a gaze, a silent word. Regardless what it is that you want to achieve.

I look forward to a life that welcomes The Pursuit, that looks forward to it and embraces it. That enjoys every part of it. And that repeats it all over again. All the time.
