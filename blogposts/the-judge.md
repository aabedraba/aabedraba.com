[The Judge](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1872194) tells a story about a father (Robert Duvall) and the broken relationship with his child, played by Robert Downey Jr. 

This is yet another movie of what I call "Hollywood capitalizing on dysnfunctional families' stories". And they rightfully should do! God knows these movies are catalysts for most of us who, one way or another, have been victims of these tales.

The acting is superb and the relationships were so well built. A lot of directors try so hard to make any silent scene in the movie have a voice, but David Dobkin has a such a velvet touch on it, he doesn't try to dumb the scene down and just consistenly gets the point accross.

I also really liked the instrumental guitars. I'm really tuned to get triggered by those sounds :) 

For any of us who lost a parent, specially a father, this movie will consistenly make you cry like a baby, regardless of the times you watch it. Such a humbling and real experience...
