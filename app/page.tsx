      Hi, I'm <strong>Abdallah</strong>! ðŸ‘‹
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      An engineer at heart, but rather than settling into one role, I've
      embraced the nature of small startup teams where I've worked as an
      engineer, developer relations lead, and product lead.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Deeply passionate about developer tooling and communities.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      You'll usually find me reading, watching youtube (we need to start calling
      this the hobby that it is), running, studying some jazz or helping others
      in their startup journey.
